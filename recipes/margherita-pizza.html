    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornmeal or semolina flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (preferably San Marzano tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the active dry yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting (usually around 500째F/260째C) and place a pizza stone or upside-down baking sheet in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half for two pizzas. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a circle, about 10-12 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper dusted with cornmeal or semolina flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sliced fresh mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by the fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the top and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the assembled pizza to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and toppings for the second pizza.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!</li>
