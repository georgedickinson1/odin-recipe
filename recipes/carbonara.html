    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) spaghetti or pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>4 ounces (115g) pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta over medium heat until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and add the cooked spaghetti to the pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine, ensuring that the spaghetti is evenly coated with the pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Quickly pour the egg and Parmesan mixture over the spaghetti, tossing continuously to coat the pasta in the creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it.</li>
        <li>Season the carbonara with freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide the carbonara among serving plates and garnish with extra grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade carbonara!</li>
    </ol>
